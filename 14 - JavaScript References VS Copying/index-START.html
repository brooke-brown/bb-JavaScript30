    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);
    // age is 200, age2 is 100
    
    let name = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'Wesley';
    console.log(name, name2);
    // name is Wesley, name2 is Wes

    // strings, numbers, and booleans are primitive value is JS

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // team is not an array; merely a reference to the original array, so players is also updated


    const team2 = players.slice(); // this will return entire array, if nothing is passed in, returns a copy
    // one way
    const team3 = [].concat(players); // this will also return a copy of the array
// the .concat method will return a new array, so we can use it to create a copy

  

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; // a spread operator will take the array and spread it out into a new array

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    // now when we update it, the original one is also changed



    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
const cap3 = { ...person, number: 99, age: 12 };
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
const me = {
  name: 'name',
  age: 50.
  social: {
    twitter: '@random',
    facebook: 'random'
  }
};
const dev = Object.assign({}, me); // this will only copy the first level, so social will still be a reference to the original object

const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(me)); // this will create a deep copy of the object, but it will not work with functions or undefined values
